# SciComp-2019
Repository for 3IE1: Introduction to Scientific Computing - Winter 2019

## Introduction

Scientific computing—using computer algorithms to solve scientific problems—plays an important role in research for many modern scientific disciplines. By developing computer programs that collect, refine, analyze, and visualize experimental data, scientists are able to explore new scientific hypotheses, and broaden their understanding of physical phenomena and relationships. Even in cases where datasets are small and relatively straightforward, using scripted, programming approaches can greatly improve the efficiency and the reproducibility of scientific analysis. 

Further to this point, it is very likely that as your scientific career progresses, you will find yourself in a situation where using a programmatic approach is required to complete your research work, and/or immensely beneficial and timesaving in comparison to other approaches. Though you may not have expertise with a specific programming application, having knowledge of the basics of programming and scientific computing, and the confidence to experiment and continue to learn will be invaluable assets.  To this end, the goal of this course is to develop both of these aspects, while also introducing you to best practices in creating and maintaining scientific code. 

In this course, students will use [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) to learn and apply the basics of scientific computing and programming. Through the in-class guidance of the instructor and a take-home task, students will apply programmatic approaches to analyze and visualize real observational scientific datasets, in order to evaluate scientific hypotheses. In addition, students will gain experience with best practices in developing, updating, and sharing scientific code, through an introduction to commenting, documentation, and git and [Github](https://github.com) for version control and code publishing.

## Learning Objectives
Through participation in the course, students will develop a number of knowledge- and skill-based competencies. By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Navigate and operate the MATLAB computing environment;
2. Use git and github for version control, code publishing, and sharing;
3. Apply basic elements of commenting and markdown to create documentation;
4. Describe the various variable types and control structures available in MATLAB (and generally in any programming language), and discuss why, when, and how they might be used in a scientific computing approach;
5. Apply principles of scientific computing to perform future data analyses and visualization

## Course Details
Instructor: Jay Brodeur
Term: Spring 2018
Class size cap: 25 students

**Schedule and location**

| Date | Time | Location |
|:----|:-----|:----|
|Saturday, 2-Feb, 2019 | 0930 - 1600 | BSB 241 (and/or Mills Wong Classroom)|
|Wednesday, 9-Feb, 2019 | 1900 - 2200 | BSB 241 (and/or Mills Wong Classroom)|

## Required materials: 
Students may be asked to bring a personal laptop computer to the session to facilitate some work that is not possible given the computer lab workstation software. 

## Assessment and Course Deliverables:
The class will be graded on a pass/fail basis.  There will be a total of three evaluation components; all components must be passed in order to pass the course.  
- Under instructor guidance, students will participate in a hands-on introduction to scientific computing and the MATLAB environment.
- Students will select a project from a small selection of choices that will be provided by the instructor. Students will be assigned a number of requirements, and will work independently (with assistance from the instructor or peers, as necessary) to develop programmatic approaches to meet the requirements. All datasets and background information required to complete the tasks will be required. 
- Students will be required to comment their code appropriately, use git to track versions, and will archive their products (code and data) using [Github](https://github.com/). As a final passing requirement, the contents of the Github repository must be understandable and executable by the instructor and other students.
